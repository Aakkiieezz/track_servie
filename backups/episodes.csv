One day, Banri is called back to his apartment because of a plumbing leak, but when he arrives he meets Nana again, who reveals that she is his neighbor, and that she faked the leak to get him to meet with Linda. Back in Banri's apartment, he apologizes for his behavior, and the two rekindle their friendship, just as Banri gets a call from Kōko who worries that Mitsuo might be in trouble.

Banri goes to check on Mitsuo after a call from Kōko, and finds him depressed due to telling Chinami to stay away from him due to rumors about her rejecting him. Deciding to cheer him up, Banri, Nijigen, and Kōko take Mitsuo to an amusement park, but when Chinami calls, Kōko also invites her, to reconcile her and Mitsuo.

Afterwards they all spend the night at Banri's apartment, but while everyone sleeps, Banri texts Linda, who was next door, and they meet on the balcony. After reminiscing about their old relationship, Banri asks Linda what her feelings for him were in the past, and she responds that she only saw him as a friend. While seemingly accepting this, Banri blacks out for a moment and yells his desire to go back to that time, shocking them both. Linda passes off his sudden outburst and goes back inside, but the spirit of Banri reaffirms his love and desire to be with Linda, but notes he cannot leave the current Banri without disappearing.

When she does return, Banri notices she is dejected, but she denies anything is wrong, until she breaks down in tears and relays to Banri her fears that he might one day leave her. Banri reassures her he will not, and the spirit of Banri, who was observing, comments on a similar situation between him and Linda. In a flashback to the summer of their third year in high school, Linda tells Banri that she learned that her brother's fiancé was having an affair, and gets him to help her expose it. When the two photograph the affair, Linda has a change of heart and deletes all the photos, and instead confronts her brother's fiancé and tells her she will keep it secret, but to never let it happen again. Afterwards, Barni vehemently voices his disapproval of her decision, but apologizes when he notices how troubled she is by her own deceit. Banri comforts Linda by saying she is not alone, and he will bear the lie she knows with her, and will always find her and be there for her, but he fails to reassure her when she asks. In the present time, Banri and Linda meet and talk, where Banri mentions Kōko is sick again, while Linda mentions her family and brother. When Banri shows he does not remember she had a brother, a saddened Linda leaves, but not before she uses the words he used to comfort her in the past to encourage him to be there for Kōko. The spirit of Banri who witnessed this, regrets that he did not confess his true feelings for Linda in the moment she sought reassurance from him, and notes that it is too late for them. However the next morning, the spirit of Banri awakens to find himself back inside his physical body.

He returns to being ""new"" Banri, and sees in the mirror Kōko gave him that he has cut his chin. Despite not being a serious injury, Banri feels ill. He discovers the hidden picture of Linda and himself is missing. He tries to go to the hospital by himself, but Nana finds him and takes him there. On the way home he tells Nana that he had the wrong idea about her, and that she is actually really nice. She listens with her usual cool attitude. Once home, she passes him off to a waiting Linda, who accuses her of beating up Banri. Nana tells Linda that she only helped him, and leaves Linda and Banri by themselves. Linda takes care of Banri for a while, feeding him water and medicine. Banri reflects on the conflicting emotions he experiences about Linda and Kōko. Kōko arrives with a bouquet of roses and accuses Banri of cheating because he's alone in his apartment with Linda. Banri and Linda are taken aback until Kōko reveals she's kidding, tossing the roses aside. 2D-kun and Mitsuo arrive and jokingly argue over who caught the bouquet and will get married first. Kōko assures everyone present that she was really kidding, and that she knows that Banri would never cheat on her. She goes a little over the top about the subject, and gets chided by Linda who tells her to cut it out. Kōko, in turn, chides Banri for not telling her that Nana lived next door, but forgives him anyway. She also thanks Linda for taking care of Banri, but Mitsuo suspects she is not being honest about her true feelings. They begin to argue, but Linda stops them for Banri's sake. Kōko admits that having another woman take care of him before she could get there did make her a little jealous. Linda admits that Nana took care of him first. Everyone discusses summer vacation plans, and decide to go to the beach together. Later that night, Banri awakens and finds Kōko still there and watching over him. Kōko apologizes for not taking care of him properly and making a fuss when he was not feeling well. She becomes depressed, telling Banri that she could never be a good girlfriend. Banri gives her an assuring hug, and asks if she's not entirely over her own cold yet. She assures him that she couldn't have come and seen him if that were the case. She admits that she wanted to go to the beach only with him, and asks if he will take her when he's better. She further states that ""it doesn't have to be Paris"", referring to her ideal ""first time"" location. Banri promises that he will take her once summer vacation arrives.

They meet up with the rest of the Festival Club, and discuss the preparations needed before the festival. Afterwards Banri speaks with the upperclassmen and asks for advice about his beach trip with Kōko. When they find out that Banri only intends to take her by train for a day trip, they tell him that a classy girl like Kōko won't be happy with the low-budget, simple trip he has planned. They advise him to get a job and make some money. Later Kōko tells him that she doesn't want him to get a job because it would mean they wouldn't get to see each other much. Kōko offers to pay for both of them on their trip. She tells him that she wants to spend as much time with him as she can, and admits that she worries about what he's doing when they're not together. She says that she knows she is awkward, overbearing, and annoying, but says she's learning to hold back. Kōko then tells Banri that she wishes she could shrink him down so that she can keep him with her in her bag for safety. Oka-chan walks up and says hello, then announces that she is on her way to her part time job. Oka-chan advises Banri that her employer is looking for more people, so they follow her to the upscale cafe where she works. Kōko, though, forbids Banri from working. Banri visits Nana to pay her back for cab fare and bring her cookies. Upon finding out Banri needs money, Nana invites him to be a waiter at a weekend party. She also insists he bring Mitsuo with him. Mitsuo resists the idea until the Tea Club tries to recruit them for questionable employment. On the night of the party Banri tells Mitsuo that Kōko had wanted to come over, but that he told her he had to work on a report. At the party, Banri finds himself dressed as a maid.

Later, the Festival Club gathers at the Awa dance festival and prepares to perform. Almost everyone is in a jovial mood, but Kōko is experiencing severe stage fright. She tries to run to the restroom, but Linda points out that she's been there about thirty times, and that her urge to urinate is a result of her nervous condition. The festival is about to start, so the other club members start to abandon Kōko where she sits. Linda then suggests they teach the first years about ""that"". ""That"" turns out to be the club performing a special dance as they circle around Kōko and Banri. Banri joins the circle, and soon Kōko does too. With everyone now ready, they successfully perform in the festival. Afterwards, Kōko and Banri enjoy the festival together and get ready to watch the fireworks. Ghost Banri watches nearby, lamenting that he still loves Linda and that Banri has rejected the feelings he left behind. He vows to become an evil spirit and curse Banri with unhappiness. It suddenly starts to rain, forcing Kōko and Banri to seek shelter. Later, Banri receives word that the Festival Club's camp has been cancelled. He reflects on how his summer activities have so far been cancelled or interrupted. He sees Kōko get out of a cab in front of his building, so he waits by the elevator to surprise her. As the doors open he does a ""peek-a-boo"" greeting. The occupant, however, turns out to be Nana, who punches him in the face and leaves him lying on the floor. Kōko (who ran up the stairs) arrives and announces she is going to make yakisoba for him. Banri is excited, but Kōko insists that he sit blindfolded with his hands in his pockets while she cooks. It turns out she is only feigning cooking, having actually brought pre-prepared yakisoba with her. The blindfold slips, allowing Banri to see what is really going on. Kōko is embarrassed, and insists it was all a joke. Later, on an evening walk, she admits that her family’s maid prepared the Yakisoba. They stop and sit in a park where they discuss Kōko possibly enrolling in culinary school and her family’s upcoming vacation to Barcelona. Kōko tries to kiss Banri, but he pulls back and walks away.

She is suspicious until Banri hands over the phone and she discovers it is 2D-kun to whom Banri is speaking. Finding out that Mitsuo may have a girlfriend, she formulates a plan to determine her identity and enlists Banri's and 2D-kun's help. They start by watching Oka-chan’s house, thinking that she is the most likely candidate. Oka-chan discovers them, though, so Banri tells her they were just visiting her. To their surprise she tells them she’s free to hang out, and when asked she admits that she’s not seeing anyone and that she hasn't seen Mitsuo since summer vacation started. Oka-chan invites them in, where they observe that the house is empty except for Oka-chan’s room. She explains that her family has moved away and that she will live alone while she finishes college. Kōko admits that she’s jealous of Oka-chan. Oka-chan replies that she is worried about living on her own for the first time. They reaffirm their decision to go to the beach together.

To allow Mitsuo and Linda some privacy they decide to go somewhere else. Later Kōko arrives at Oka-chan’s house with a bag full of swimsuits. The two of them try the swimsuits on, and discuss Kōko’s and Banri’s relationship, and Kōko tells about Banri resisting her kiss in the park. She admits that she never feels they are “in the mood” when she and Banri are alone in his apartment. Oka-chan points out that Banri probably resists because he wants to show Kōko how much he really cares for her. Kōko tells Oka-chan that she wishes she could spend more time with Banri at his apartment. She admits that she questions whether Banri really loves her and is afraid he will disappear someday. She wonders if Banri is trying to find himself and if he does so if will he leave her. Kōko then states that the next two swimsuits she pulls out of her bag will be what she and Oka-chan will wear to the beach. They turn out to be school swimsuits. Oka-chan likes the idea and films them while wearing the swimsuits. Later in Banri’s apartment, Mitsuo and Banri discuss their swimwear choices as well.

After fiddling with the notes he made for himself prior to the return of his former memories, Banri opens his e-mail account and discovers that someone has been sending e-mails to Kōko under his name. Linda and Banri seem to have returned to their easy friendship, with Linda spending Christmas with the Tada family. He contemplates Linda's reply to his feelings and the happenings that occurred between them since his accident. Kōko arrives at Banri's home. Banri first mistakes her for Chinami. Kōko hands Banri a DVD and his cracked mirror case, which Banri sees as Kōko's belonging and returns it to her. After asking for directions for the bridge where Banri fell, Kōko leaves and Banri finally remembers Kōko after finding her mirror case alongside his notes. As a result, Banri goes after Kōko to the bridge where he meets his conflicted former self. The latter then cross the bridge after Linda appears and gives her reply to his feelings with a ""Yes"" and hands Banri the ring he had dropped at the bridge days before. Afterwards, Banri embraces Kōko and the two recall their promise: that as long as they remember one another, the two will stay together for the rest of their lives. They profess their love for one another and Banri presents his ring to Kōko, which she gladly accepts. Meanwhile, it's revealed that Nijigen was responsible for sending spam e-mails as Banri and motivated Kōko to go after him. Taking advantage of Kōko's motivation, Chinami edited the recording Banri made of himself and burned it to a DVD, which she asked Kōko to deliver to Banri. While watching his recording, Banri thanks Kōko for being by his side. Banri later returns to Tokyo and attends university with his friends. His relationship with Kōko is still intact. Mitsuo and Linda are shown flirting while Kōko and Banri kiss with Kōko wearing the ring Banri gave her.

Aru sets up Yuki and Yuno on a date to a bridal fair, where they meet Keigo's wife, while he investigates Yuno's house. When Yuki and Yuno return, they find Aru at the door of the room with the corpses. However, the wall has been demolished and the corpses buried in a deep hole in Yuno's garden. Even though this is Yuno's doing, she has no recollection of the event, nor of Yuki visiting her house before. Aru theorises that Yuno's mental balance is so fragile that she modified her own memories as a defense mechanism. Meanwhile, Keigo frames Yuki and Yuno as suspects for his murder of Hinata's father.","24","/i0BFBW0aQvYbjVoSghPzCWEKg4j.jpg","Family Plan"
"46671","911830","54822","1","11","In a flashback, Keigo forms an alliance with Uryu, promising to stop pursuing her and asking her to take care of his terminally ill son if he is eliminated from the Survival Game. Yuki and Yuno get arrested and brought to Keigo. In the interrogation room, Keigo forces Yuki to play a rigged game of Russian Roulette with his service revolver. Alerted to Keigo's treachery by her diary, Yuno knocks out the detectives guarding her and steals their guns. Just before Yuki gets shot, Yuno breaks into the room, injures Keigo and leaves with Yuki. Panicking, Yuki shoots at one of the policemen pursuing them. Since both Yuki and Yuno have now committed a crime, their actions can be detected by Keigo's diary, which was his plan all along. Trapped at the police station's roof, Yuki and Yuno jump off, but a truck's tarp breaks their fall. The next day, Yuki and Yuno are hiding from the police when they notice Keigo's wife visiting a hospital. When they follow her, they get ambushed by Uryu, who blows part of the floor up. After Yuki accidentally causes more of the floor to collapse, Uryu allies with Yuki in order to have Yuno pull them both to safety, incurring Keigo's wrath in the process. With their deaths foretold in all three diaries, Uryu takes Yuki and Yuno to the room where Keigo's son and wife are.","24","/nO9Wf6yDYxM2adnsqnbVMJ7FSpw.jpg","Service Terminated"
"46671","911831","54822","1","12","While the police surrounds the hospital, Uryu takes Keigo's wife and son hostage and tries to bargain with him. However, Keigo is convinced the only way to save his family is to win the survival game and refuses to negotiate. Yuki gets captured by the police, but as Keigo takes hold of him, Yuno appears, holding a grenade. Even when Keigo agrees to let Yuki go, Yuno decides to detonate the grenade, reasoning she'd rather die taking out Keigo than not be with Yuki. The grenade turns out to be a flash bang, knocking everyone out. Meanwhile, Uryu tries to escape the hospital, only to run into Nishijima. She tells him about the deal she and Keigo made and how he framed Yuki and Yuno, and they both rush back to the hospital. Yuki regains consciousness and tries to shoot at Keigo, but he uses Yuno as a shield. Despite his diary predicting he will kill Yuno if he shoots, Yuki refuses to give up, proclaiming his love for her. The future somehow changes and Yuki gets a clean shot at Keigo. Uryu arrives with Nishijima, who places Keigo under arrest. Since he's no longer a detective, his Investigation diary stops predicting the future. After learning his family has been rescued, Keigo asks Uryu to take care of his son, apologises to Yuki and breaks his own diary, removing himself from existence. Yuki and Yuno are exonerated thanks to files Keigo left behind, while Uryu escapes yet again. A few days later, Aru sends Yuki a text message warning him about Yuno, but she intercepts and deletes it.","24","/zoO3UQ2vVreU1M7kNCZSlug9jM1.jpg","No Service Area"

When he threatens to give this information to the police unless she releases them, the stress causes Yuno to alter her memory again, rendering negotiations moot. As Kousaka uses his cell phone to post his will in his blog, it is apparently turned into a Future Diary by the Eighth diary holder, who adresses him as an ""apprentice"". On Aru's advice, Kousaka acts out his diary's predictions, reaching an amnesiac Yuno, a catatonic Yuki and a bound Hinata in the control room. His appearance causes Yuki to recover, recalling how Yuno abducted him to keep him safe until July 28th. Yuno places the key to Yuki's shackles on the floor and tosses Kousaka the control panel key, allowing him to free Aru and Mao. Yuno then takes advantage of Kousaka's distraction and shoots at him with a crossbow. However, Yuki, having had his key kicked over to him by Hinata, frees himself and stops Yuno, leaving her behind when his diary predicts the imminent arrival of three diary holders, all apprentices of the Eighth.","24","/e2MZcSGdmFu4GZNJRU8rTUeJfIN.jpg","Memory Erased"

Yuki and Yuno go on a stargazing trip, but Yuno alters their destination along the way. Worried about Yuki's safety, Aru contacts Nishijima and they manage to narrow Yuki and Yuno's location down to a run-down holiday resort, enlisting Hinata, Mao and Kousaka to search for them. As they split up and search the abandoned hotels, Aru and Kousaka face various traps set by Yuno, while Hinata is tricked by a text message Yuno sent from Yuki's phone. When the others attempt to find Hinata, they get locked in a room which starts to fill up with gas. At the end of the episode, Yuki is shown bound to a chair, with an ecstatic Yuno sitting between two skulls.","24","/z709bNAYmmVL63uuLPlLYlAb9W.jpg","Number Withheld"

In order to confuse them, he has Uryu feed Yuki false information. Yuki's father visits him in the hospital, but while Yuki's away, he searches the room for his cell phone. Yuno overhears that he has promised to destroy it in return for the cancellation of his substantial debt and realises he is being used by the Eleventh diary holder. Marco, who's learned all about the situation from Yuki's diary, considers Yuki's father a useful link to Uryu and the Eleventh and calls Yuno, demanding that they bring Yuki's father to an abandoned commercial tower. Once they arrive, Marco places Yuki and Yuno's phones on a table and attacks Yuki's father. As Yuki futilely fights Marco, his father goes over to the table and breaks his phone. However, nothing happens. Yuno, who's realised that the phones were decoys, attacks Ai and successfully retrieves both diaries. Just then, Marco and Ai's apprentice friend sets off explosives. The floor under Yuki collapses and both his father and Yuno reach out to grab him. Meanwhile, Nishijima has uncovered the identity of Eighth, a children's caretaker called Kamado Ueshita, and goes to search her orphanage.","24","/805lIjs2xnjZiDmIl0EPbpkn3Zy.jpg","Repair"

When Yuki's diary predicts an attack by three of them, Aru has him moved to Kousaka's mansion. His plan is to lure the apprentices in, then deactivate the area's cell phone tower, severing their connection to the Eighth's server. Once the attack begins, however, Yuno appears and cuts the power to the tower remote control, wanting to defend Yuki by herself. Aru and Kousaka rush to deactivate the tower manually, while Yuki keeps Yuno in restraints. Two of Eighth's apprentices, Marco Ikusaba and Ai Mikami, manage to corner Yuki and Yuno by the time Aru deactivates the tower. However, Marco and Ai reveal that they are also the ""owner"" of a bona fide Future Diary, which has remained unaffected. With no other choice, Yuki releases Yuno, who intimidates the couple into retreating. When the third apprentice sets the mansion on fire, however, Marco and Ai counterattack. Their diaries' ability to predict each other's actions manages to overwhelm Yuno, resulting in her and Yuki getting injured and their diaries taken away.

Yuno catches up to them and once again tries to fight them alone, while Yuki hides and attempts to help her with his diary's predictions. Yuno loses and has her phone taken away, but it turns out to be Marco and Ai's decoy, which distracts them with false predictions. As a result, Yuno manages to critically injure Ai. Yuki's father grabs one of the two parachutes and escapes the tower, but he runs into Yuki's mother, who has been informed of the situation by Nishijima. When she threatens to turn him in, he stabs her. Yuki, Yuno and a dying Ai are trapped in the wreckage, but Marco attempts to free Ai despite having been mortally wounded himself. With Yuki and Yuno's help, the debris is cleared out and Marco and Ai die together as the tower collapses. Yuki and Yuno escape using the second parachute, only to find Yuki's mother has died.

After she fell in love with Yuki, he became her sole reason to live. Yuki asks Deus to bring his mother back to life, but he reveals that he is dying and his powers have faded. Furthermore, unless a successor is determined soon, all existence will collapse. When Yuki's father returns home, Yuki, who knows he killed his mother from his diary, demands that he turn himself in. However, his father points out that he has no evidence. The next day, Yuki goes after his father, expecting him to lead him to evidence. However, it turns out that Yuki's father wanted to visit the site where his family was going to go stargazing before he turned himself in. As Yuki reconciles with his father, they are ambushed by agents of Eleventh and Yuki's father is murdered. Enraged, Yuki fights back and manages, with Yuno's help, to kill the attackers. Afterwards, Yuki declares that he is now determined to win the survival game in order to attain the power to resurrect his parents.

He then attends Deus' meeting, where Yuki and Yuno, having deduced his identity, expose him as the Eleventh diary holder. Uryu relays these news to Nishijima, who reveals he's been reassigned as Balks' bodyguard. Furthermore, he's discovered that Yuno was adopted. Yuno theorises that Balks wants to seize Kamado's Future Diary server, so she has Yuki form an alliance with her. Yuki, Yuno, Kamado and her apprentices ambush Balks' car on a country road, but he uses a jammer to sever connections to Kamado's server. Yuki and Yuno, who anticipated this, betray Kamado and slaughter her defenseless apprentices. Kamado flees in Balks' car, while Yuki and Yuno give chase. As Yuki and Yuno corner Balks and Kamado, Uryu appears with Aru. Aru reveals he's retrieved Yuno's umbilical cord from her orphanage and that its DNA matches the third corpse's, meaning that the real Yuno Gasai is dead and the one Yuki has known all along is actually an imposter.","24","/zlcwxiprciPnBHo6CWyvOyjQdP4.jpg","Clear Data"

Balks locks himself in a vault belonging to Yuno's parents' bank, which can only be unlocked by himself, Yuno's parents, and the real Yuno. Uryu, reasoning that Yuki can no longer eliminate Balks for her, starts hunting him. As she does, she tells him how she lost her parents in the Middle East as a child and grew up under the constant threat of death. At the same time, Yuno frees Yuki's friends and goes to kill Kamado, but she is stopped by Aru. In a tense showdown between Uryu and Yuki, the former sees her innocent child self in the latter and lets him shoot her. Uryu then destroys her diary voluntarily in order to detonate a bomb triggered by her death, intending to destroy the vault door for Yuki. However, the door withstands the blast. Yuno arrives, sends Yuki away to destroy HOLON, and somehow manages to open the vault door and kill Balks. A few days later, dark vortices appear all over the city. In Deus' realm, Murmur is panicking over the world ending sooner than expected, when Kamado appears with Aru, who asks Deus if it is really possible for his successor to return the world to the way it was.","24","/hRx5UTqutaAdULnUJvDk8MfrdRX.jpg","Security Code"

However, it turns out to be only one part of the whole, and Balks' plan is put into motion. As Aru sends Hinata, Mao and Kousaka to help Uryu and Nishijima destroy the remaining parts of HOLON, Uryu figures out Balks' diary can read the predictions of all other Future Diaries. Deus reveals to Uryu that Balks helped him design the Future Diaries, wishing to grant divine power to the human race. Uryu, Nishijima, Hinata, Mao and Kousaka storm HOLON's location, overwriting their diaries' predictions to confuse Balks. In response, Balks makes use of his secretary's diary and manages to capture Hinata, Mao and Kousaka, as well as injure Uryu and kill Nishijima.

Deus reveals that Aru is an entity created by him to observe and record information on the survival game and starts disassembling him, promising to spare him if he proves he has done anything out of his own free will. Aru succeeds when he reveals he had Kamado make his diary into an apprentice diary, wishing to change the future and save Yuki. As Yuki and Yuno arrive at Aru's apartment to kill Kamado, they're held off by Aru. Yuno starts fighting Aru, while Yuki chases after Kamado and his friends. When he runs into Hinata, she tells him what Aru learned from Deus: even the divine power bestowed to the winner of the survival game cannot bring the souls of the dead back. Meanwhile, Yuno, who has been cornered by Akise, stabs herself and calls Yuki, tricking him into thinking everyone is deceiving him. Yuki kills Hinata, Mao and Kousaka, believing he can bring them back to life later. Aru reaches Yuki and warns him that Yuno plans to kill him. Yuno catches up to Aru and they fight again. Although Aru breaks Yuno's diary, she doesn't vanish; she produces a second cell phone from her pocket, claiming the first one was a fake, and slashes at Aru's throat. As Yuno kills Kamado, a dying Aru, who knows the diary he destroyed was real, suddenly has an epiphany about Yuno. Since he can no longer talk, he writes a message in his phone and shows it to Yuki, allowing Yuno to finish him off as Deus collapses.","24","/sDtdzneA3BmtdIHzQBoeiA57f5Z.jpg","Disconnect"

Yuno reminds Yuki about her diary's prediction that they will ""become one"" on that day. As the days pass, Yuki eventually admits to himself that his friends were probably telling the truth. Since he can't understand why Yuno would lie to him, he decides to get the truth from her by fulfilling her diary's prediction earlier. On July 27th, Yuki and Yuno make love, ""becoming one"". Afterward, Yuki asks Yuno why she lied about resurrecting people being possible. Yuno says that she just wanted to console him and asks him to kill her. Yuki refuses and instead suggests that they die together. When he mentions Aru's message, which claimed that this universe is a second iteration of a world in which Yuno became a goddess and travelled back in time, Yuno attacks him. As he runs away, Yuki is intercepted by Murmur, who shows him visions of the past. Murmur confirms that Yuno has indeed played the survival game once before. In the ""first world"", where she and Yuki also ended up as the last contestants, both agreed to commit suicide rather than having to kill the other. However, Yuno only pretended to kill herself, thinking she could bring Yuki back as a goddess. When she discovered she could not restore souls, Yuno, wishing to see Yuki again, travelled back in time and killed her other self, taking her place. Distraught at the death of the second Yuno, Yuki breaks out of the vision and confronts Yuno.","24","/9NSBehjxgaetucTPUJjrIGETjR7.jpg","Unfulfilled Contract"

Cornered, Murmur and Yuno travel two years back in time to a ""third world"", followed by Uryu and Yuki. Uryu explains to Yuki that when Deus realised Murmur was favouring Yuno, he suspected them of being from another timeline. In order to ensure the fair running of the game, he imparted Uryu with part of his power, although she did not know so at the time. Knowing that Yuno intends to kill her past self in this world as well, Yuki rushes to her house with Uryu. When Yuki finds the third Yuno locked in a cage and choking on a mat she tried to eat, he calls for an ambulance, despite Uryu's warnings about interfering with the past.

Yuki evades Yuno and Murmur's attacks, trying to convince Yuno to return to the second world and rule as its goddess. However, Yuno, torn between her feelings for Yuki and the inevitability of the second world's destruction unless one of them dies, decides to trap him in an illusionary ""ideal"" world where his parents are alive and she has never existed.

Yuki manages to remember Yuno and break free from the illusionary world, in the process releasing his world's Murmur, who had been trapped by her first world self in order to impersonate her. Faced with Yuki's love and her other self's united family, Yuno's resolve to kill them all is lost, and she decides to commit suicide.
